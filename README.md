Implementing the Break Out Game 
==========================

In this project, I coded up the Break Out Video game. For background information about what the break out game is, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) is the Wikipedia page that explains it. 

The goal of this project was to create a fun playale game in basic [good Java coding style](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f8MYlvmXKbWY1Qul14MpXvaqOoBLaQG0KlHo7IWZX8g/edit?usp=sharing).
